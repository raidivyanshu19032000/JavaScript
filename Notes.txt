1. What is the global object of browser
=> Windows => To check type in console => console.log(this)


2. Differece between function and Arrow function ? 
=> 


3. Map, Filter and Reduce ? 
=> map():
    Definition: The map() method is used to create a new array by applying a function to each element of the original array. It doesn't modify the original array.

    Key Points:
        Returns a new array.
        The length of the new array is the same as the original array.

        example: 
        const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        const squared = numbers.map(num => num * num);
        console.log(squared); // Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
        
  filter():
    Definition: The filter() method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. It doesn't modify the original array.

    Key Points:
        Returns a new array.
        Only includes elements that satisfy the condition (return true).

        example: 
        const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);
        console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4]

  reduce():
    Definition: The reduce() method executes a reducer function on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value. It can be used for aggregations or transformations.

    Key Points:
        Takes two arguments: a callback function and an optional initial value.
        The callback function has four parameters: accumulator, currentValue, currentIndex, and array.

        example:
        const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        const sum = numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue, 0);
        console.log(sum); // Output: 15
